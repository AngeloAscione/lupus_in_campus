# 🛠️ Lupus in Campus – Backend Server

**Lupus in Campus** is a multiplayer Android app inspired by the classic deduction game *Lupus in Tabula* (Werewolf), developed to bring the thrilling gameplay experience into the digital world — even remotely. This document describes the backend server component, implemented in **Java with Spring Boot**, designed to manage game logic, user data, matchmaking, and communication.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The backend provides RESTful services that support the following core features:

- Player registration and authentication
- Creation and management of public/private/local lobbies
- Automatic role assignment and turn-based logic
- Chat system (text and voice)
- Friends list and social interactions
- Notification management (invites, errors, updates)

The system is designed with educational, collaborative, and entertainment goals, reflecting the student life and culture of the **University of Salerno**.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The backend follows the **MVC pattern**, with the following major modules:

- **Authentication**: Login, logout, registration, password reset
- **User Management**: Profile, match history, friend list
- **Lobby Management**: Create, join, leave, and invite to lobbies
- **Game Management**: Turn control, vote handling, role assignment
- **Communication System**: Text and voice chat logic
- **Notification System**: Push notifications (game state, invites)
- **Persistence**: JPA-based data storage on Azure SQL/MySQL

Each subsystem is mapped to dedicated controllers, services, and repositories.
